# Taylor

![documentation workflow](https://github.com/HellRok/Taylor/actions/workflows/documentation.yml/badge.svg)

## What's this?

Taylor is a game framework I've built using [mruby](http://mruby.org/) and
[raylib](https://www.raylib.com/). I'm trying to build a very simple way for
people to get into game development. This is trying to replicate the simplicity
of QBasic but with a more of a modern approach.

## To Do

1. Get the test running on GitHub actions, this is tricky due to requiring
   OpenGL
2. Finish mapping the rest of raylib, so far I think I've done about 30%
3. Backtraces from mruby don't work, I think I need to compile it specially
4. Allow users to compile their ruby code into a single executable
5. Build an actual game with this
