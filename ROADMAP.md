# Taylor Roadmap

## 0.3.12

- Support native OSX Apple architecture support for exports
- Upgrade to mruby 3.2.0-rc

## 0.3.13

- Finish shader implementation for 2D

## 0.3.14

- Finish Android support

## 0.4.0

- Get rid of the `load` methods in favour of just doing it in `new` for
  resources as we'll never want to manually create them (or at least if we do
  it's not going to be the most common way of using these objects)

## 1.0.0

- Once I feel I've fully polished everything for 2D
- Game exporting is seemless
- Improve the experience on Windows

## 2.0.0

- 3D support
